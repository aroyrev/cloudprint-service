cloudprint (0.10-7) unstable; urgency=low

    Use Linux to share your printers via Google Cloud Print.

    This is the first public release of cloudprint-service, based on the
    cloudprint proxy script.

    Cloudprint-service adds a service to your Linux computer that makes your
    printers available via Google Cloud Print. This can make the printer
    persistently available to other users, other devices, or other sites,
    under your control. Plus, no special printer drivers are needed to
    access the shared print queue.

    This should generally work with any distribution which uses .deb
    files for software installation.
