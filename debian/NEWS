cloudprint (0.13-1+deb8u2) stable; urgency=medium

    Cloudprint has been updated to use the OAuth2 authentication mechanism.
    The program will attempt to log in. If it is not successful, it will
    print a URL that can be used in a graphical browser to claim the printers
    for a particular user account. cloudprint-service users can use the
    cps-auth script to establish credentials.
