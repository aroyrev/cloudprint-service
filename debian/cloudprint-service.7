.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
service \fBcloudprintd\fR \fIlogin\fR
Verify that Cloud Print login credentials are established. If so, it will

the local printer(s), and wait for the user to complete the process.
.TP
service \fBcloudprintd\fR \fIstart\fR
Start the \fBcloudprintd\fR service. This will fail if the credentials have not been
established. The service will normally start automatically when the computer
is running.
.TP
service \fBcloudprintd\fR \fIstop\fR
Stop the \fBcloudprintd\fR service. Login credentials are not lost. Normally,
the printer will continue to be shown as a valid destination. Any jobs spooled
during that time will print when the service is restarted.
.TP
service \fBcloudprintd\fR \fIstatus\fR
Determine whether the service is running or not.
.TP
service \fBcloudprintd\fR \fIlogout\fR

another 'login'.
